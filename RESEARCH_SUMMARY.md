# Research Summary: Bible Translation with AI Assistance

**Date:** 2026-02-09  
**Issue:** Research professional Bible translation process, AI assisted, to apply to this project

---

## What Was Researched

### 1. Professional Bible Translation Standards
- **Translation philosophies:** Complete Equivalence (KJV, NASB) vs. Dynamic Equivalence (NIV, NLT)
- **Quality standards:** Accuracy, clarity, naturalness, acceptability
- **Translation stages:** Pre-translation, drafting, review, testing
- **Review process:** Multi-level verification from self-review to community testing

### 2. AI-Assisted Translation
- **Current capabilities:** Neural MT, Large Language Models (GPT-4, Claude)
- **Appropriate roles:** Drafting assistance, consistency checking, QA, research
- **Inappropriate roles:** Final authority, sole translator, theological decision-maker
- **Best practices:** Human-in-the-loop, glossary-driven, structured prompts, multi-pass translation

### 3. Vietnamese Translation Considerations
- **Linguistic challenges:** Word order, tense systems, grammatical particles
- **Theological precision:** Divine name distinctions, Protestant vs. Catholic terminology
- **Cultural adaptation:** Idiom translation, metaphor preservation, register appropriateness

### 4. Quality Assurance Framework
- **Multi-level review:** Self, automated, peer, expert, community
- **Quality metrics:** Accuracy, naturalness, consistency, usability
- **Testing methods:** Read-aloud, comprehension, liturgical, back-translation
